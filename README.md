# Password Manager

This is my take on a multi-platform password manager that can sync to serval different backends (for now, Google Drive is the only one I've implemented).

## Setup

We use `gulp` to build the app.
```
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install
$ npm update
```

## Running local

```
$ gulp
```
